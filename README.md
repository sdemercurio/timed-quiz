## General info.
Once the user clicks the start button, the user is presented with a series of multiple choice questions. The timer will begin to count down from 60 seconds. If the user chooses the correct answer, the score will increase by 10 points. If the wrong answer is chosen, the timer will deduct 10 seconds. The questions change with each button click, regardless of whether the answer is right or wrong, and the user is informed if they answered correctly or incorretly. If the user completes the quiz or if the time runs out, the user will be asked to enter their initials which will be stored with their score in the high-scores link. The user then has the option to exit or play again.

## Technologies
* Bootstrap 4
* Javascript

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
I almost complted this project. I am havig an issue with getting my timer to stop if all questions have been answered before time runs out. I would like to add the remaining time as a bonus to the points scored. This would make for a more interesting High Scores list since the high scores are ordered fro highest to lowest and only the top 5 scores make the list.
