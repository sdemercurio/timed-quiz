## General info.
Once the user clicks the start button, the user is presented with a series of multiple choice questions. The timer will begin to count down from 60 seconds. If the user chooses the correct answer, the score will increase by 10 points. If the wrong answer is chosen, the timer will deduct 10 seconds. Since this is a timed quiz, the question change with each button click, regardless of whether the answer is right or wrong. If the user completes the quiz or if the time runs out, the user will be asked to input their initials which will be stored with their score in the high-scores link.

## Technologies
* Bootstrap 4
* Javascript

I was unable to complete this assignment. This has been an incredibly challenging last couple of weeks for me and I am going to have to work exceptionally hard to understand the concepts I am still struggling with. I will complete the quiz and resubmit for feedback once I do.
